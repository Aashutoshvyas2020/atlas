# Atlas

Atlas is a hands-free computer control project built to improve everyday access for people with limited upper-limb mobility.

## Inspiration
Most computer access tools for people with limited limb movement still feel slow, outdated, or exhausting to use. When typing, clicking, or speaking all day is not realistic, basic digital independence becomes harder than it should be.

Atlas was created with one goal: make computer control faster, safer, and more practical for real daily use.

## What Atlas Is
Atlas is an assistive interface for hands-free computer interaction.

It is designed around simple, intentional control signals such as:
- nod (yes)
- shake (no)
- jaw clench
- intentional eye close

The experience is built to feel predictable and confidence-inspiring, with clear user control at every step.

## Why It Matters
Atlas is about restoring agency.

It targets a future where people with limited hand/arm control can still:
- work
- study
- browse
- communicate
- complete routine digital tasks independently

## What We Are Proud Of
- A safety-first interaction style centered on user intent
- Strong focus on reducing accidental triggers
- A practical foundation that can grow into a real assistive product

## What’s Next
- Per-user calibration profiles
- Better intentional command separation (short vs long gestures)
- Further reliability tuning for daily use
- A simple end-user tuning experience for sensitivity and comfort
